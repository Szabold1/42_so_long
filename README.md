## About

This project, named `so_long`, is a simple 2D game built with the MiniLibX library. In this game, players control a character, in this case, a monkey, navigating through a map to collect bananas and reach home while avoiding enemies (snakes). The project focuses on implementing basic game mechanics and rendering graphics using the MiniLibX library.

## Features

- Navigate the monkey character using arrow keys.
- Collect all bananas on the map to progress.
- Avoid enemies to prevent losing (bonus).
- Display the number of moves taken by the player.
- Clean exit via ESC key or clicking the close button on the window.

## Map file

The map file must adhere to the following rules:

- The map has to be in a `.ber` file.
- The map can be composed of only these characters:
- `0`: Empty space
- `1`: Wall
- `C`: Collectible (banana)
- `E`: Exit (home)
- `P`: Player's starting position (monkey)
- `X`: Enemy (bonus)(snake)
- The map must contain exactly 1 exit, at least 1 collectible, and exactly 1 starting position.
- The map must be rectangular and surrounded by walls.
- Ensure there's a valid path for the player to navigate through the map.
